# Machine_Learning
Projet : Détection du risque de crédit 

# Objectif :
Expliquer notre target defaut en fonction de plusieurs variables du
dataset
Dataset : Loan_Default.csv
Site : https://www.Kaggle.com

# Context : 
Financial institutions need to assess the risk
of loan defaults. -Accurate predictions can help in
making
informed lending decisions.
-Machine learning can analyze historical data
to predict defaults

# Goal
-Financial institutions need to assess the risk
of loan defaults. -Accurate predictions can help in
making
informed lending decisions.
-Machine learning can analyze historical data
to predict defaults
-Build a model to predict whether a loan will
default based on applicant data. -Identify the most significant
factors contributing to defaults.
-Provide recommendations for risk mitigation
 # Challenges
-Handling imbalanced datasets where defaults
are less frequent. -Feature engineering to capture
relevant applicant characteristics.
-Interpreting the model to provide actionable
insights.
